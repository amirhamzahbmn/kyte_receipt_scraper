# Kyte Receipt Scraper

Kyte as of now currently does not have a feature that allows to batch download receipts of your company's sales. You would have to download each receipt manually by hand.
This can be very tedious especially if you are in need of having those receipts on hand for bookkeeping and tax purposes.
However, after contacting them, they have mentioned that it is currently in the works. I will update this and mention so if that is the case.

As far as I know, browser automation is the only way to tackle this problem as the API used to download the receipts can only be accessed privately. As the script simulates button clicking and manually opening each receipt to download them, it can be time consuming depending on the amount of receipts you had. I had to download roughly 5000 receipts and that ended up taking around 2 hours. For privacy reasons of my customers and our shop, I am unable to showcase any screenshots or images of the script in action. I really wish I could, cuz tbh it is really cool seeing browser actions whoosh all over the place at fast speeds.

Note: My Kyte PRO package has expired so I can no longer test this script anymore as it requires it to access their desktop web version of Kyte. Honestly might even look into automating it on the phone at some point. If you are however somehow in a similar situation as I was and you are in dire need of your Kyte receipts, feel free to hit me up and I'll try my best to help you out.
