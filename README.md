# Kyte Receipt Scraper

Kyte as of now currently does not have a feature that allows to batch download receipts of your company's sales. You would have to download each receipt manually by hand.
This can be very tedious especially if you are in need of having those receipts on hand for bookkeeping and tax purposes.
However, after contacting them, they have mentioned that it is currently in the works. I will update this and mention so if that is the case.
